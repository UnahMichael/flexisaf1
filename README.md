ES6 Features:- Scope, Let, Const, Arrow Functions, Arrays(map, filter, reduce, foreach), Objects

In this project:

We use **const** to declare the tasks array, which stores our to-do list items.
The renderTasks function uses arrow functions and **array** **forEach** to render the tasks dynamically on the webpage.
When the "Add" button is clicked, an **arrow function** is used to handle the event and add a new task to the tasks array.
We also use the **object** property shorthand to simplify code readability when creating elements and appending them to the task list.
This simple to-do list application demonstrates how ES6 features can be used to write clean and concise JavaScript code.
